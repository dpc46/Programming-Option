D is both unfolded
I is R15 folded and R16 unfolded
N is both folded

Adding a denaturant (e.g. urea) will promote unfolding
The equilibrium rate constants for given concentrations were found.

One interesting effect of this reaction is that if one of the species is coloured, a well-mixed
reaction will produce timed colour changes. If the reactants are instead allowed to diffuse
(say along a 1-d line), these colour changes will manifest themselves as spatially-resolved
patterns which move over time.

1. Show that these rate constants fit the kinetic model, as outlined in section 3.3.5
2. Reproduce the dynamic spikes seen in Figure 3.4 by integrating the Oregonatorâ€™s kinetic equation
3. Sketch the design of a program (and perhaps write one) allowing a spatially resolved simulation (due to diffusion)
of the colour changes of the chemical species over time
