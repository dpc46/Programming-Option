D is both unfolded
I is R15 folded and R16 unfolded
N is both folded

Adding a denaturant (e.g. urea) will promote unfolding
The equilibrium rate constants for given concentrations were found.
These are just the 0th order constants, multiplied by some exponential factor, dependant on the denaturant concentration


One interesting effect of this reaction is that if one of the species is coloured, a well-mixed
reaction will produce timed colour changes. If the reactants are instead allowed to diffuse
(say along a 1-d line), these colour changes will manifest themselves as spatially-resolved
patterns which move over time.

Numerical Integration will be required for some coupled systems. We can Taylor expand the concentration at time t in terms
of some small time-step delta-t

1. Show that these rate constants fit the kinetic model, as outlined in section 3.3.5
2. Reproduce the dynamic spikes seen in Figure 3.4 by integrating the Oregonatorâ€™s kinetic equation
3. Sketch the design of a program (and perhaps write one) allowing a spatially resolved simulation (due to diffusion)
of the colour changes of the chemical species over time

0th Order rate constants:
kf(R15) = 26000 s-1
kf(R16) = 730 s-1
ku(R15) = 0.06 s-1
ku(R16) = 0.00075 s-1

D <=> I <=> N

Kinetic Equations:
d[D]/dt = -kf(R15)[D] + ku(R15)[I]
d[I]/dt = kf(R15)[D] - ku(R15)[I] -kf(R16)[I] + ku(R16)[N]
d[N]/dt = kf(R16)[I] - ku(R16)[N]

For the time-evolution program:
1. Define the set of points (e.g., 1D linspace)
2. Define a function that:
a. takes the time-step t, the initial reactant concentrations
and the urea concentration as it's inputs
b. Calculates the new concentrations due to folding/unfolding
c. Calculates the new concentrations due to diffusion
3. Define the plot parameters
4. Animate the plot
